These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag), and use biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) to get it from your device.\n\n\u003cb\u003eCore features of the app\u003c/b\u003e\n\n- easy two factor authentication\n- no complicated master password to memorize, it is just exported\n- easy to read generated passwords\n- strong modern encryption (AES 128/256, Blowfish, Chacha20)\n- Autofill support\n- biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) for stored master password\n- no insecure clipboard function by default\n- show passwords over other apps\n- no internet connection needed, all is offline\n- export and import credential vault\n- share and outsource credentials\n- obfuscate passwords as additional security layer\n- optional self desctruction mode after too many failed login attempts\n- Dark theme support ;-)\n\n\nFor detailed information see https://anotherpass.jepfa.de\n","source_code_url":"https://github.com/jenspfahl/ANOTHERpass","category":"Security"}
